This is my evaluation board for interfacing Telit SE880 GPS chip module with EFM32LG-STK3600 EFM32 Leopard Gecko Starter Kit.

I had lot of trouble during the SE880 chip module manufacturing, forget hot air blower! This is a 3D chip module with embedded parts, like capacitors, resistors, etc.
You need to follow the exact heat profile provided by Telit in tha datasheet. So using an SMT heat oven is highly recommended! 

My PCB is assembled (by professional contract manufacturer) and I confirm: it works! The parts are correct.

I have assambled PCBs to sell, please contact me about the details!
